# meta-Heuristic

the meta-Heuristic algorithm implementations with an example of TSP, including :
- Tabu Search (TS)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Large Scale Neighborhood Search (LSNS)
- 

Certainlyï¼ŒIt can be applied not only in TSP, but also in many problems which depends on your need.


## Numerical example

'R101.txt' is from solomon benchmark, more details can be found in https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/vrptw/solomon-benchmark/
