# Algorithm-Implementation

This repository is for learning and understanding how algorithms work, including kinds of algorithm(ML,RL,OR) implementation in details and each with a brief introduction.

Mainly coversï¼š

**OR**
- Various heuristic algorithms (e.g. Tabu search,Genetic algorithm,Simulated annealing,...)
- exact algorithm (e.g. Branch and Bound,Branch and Cut,Branch and Price,...)
- gurobi for kinds of VRPs
- ...


**RL**
- DQNs (double dqn, dueling dqn,...)
- DDPG
- PPO
- ...

**ML**
- ...
